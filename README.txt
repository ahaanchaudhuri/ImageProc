Design Changes:
from the previous version, an ImageProcessor interface and Implementation class were added in order to accurately reflect what the model for this project should be. 
Additionally, a new GUI interface and implementation were created to support the new view.
A new view system was also created to support the need for a visualization of the program.

The crab image used was open source, free to use.
